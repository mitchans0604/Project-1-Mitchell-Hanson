		<h2> Here is the report for my webpage regarding assignment requirements </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> 1. I have created a website for a client from the Super Smash Bros. Melee competitive community. The website contains information about SSBM that many people can look at 
			for an understanding of competitive Melee and how to get into the scene and play competitively. </li>
			
			<li> 2. I have multiple headers, sometimes multiple headers on the same page. Each ll with the same font and style across all my pages. </li>

			<li> 3. My site has 10 html pages named index, character_data, competitive_techniques, covid_changes,
			history, players, practice_tools, ruleset, tier_lists, and tournaments. </li>

			<li> 4. My site has a navigation bar at the top of the screen at all times during the page. This lets you
			access the other pages on the website. The navigation bar link is colored green to indicate what page
			you are currently on. </li>

			<li> 5. My webpages have media queries that support larger and smaller screens based on max-width.
			How I have used some of my media queries is for images, text and header sizes, and the navigation bar size. </li>

			<li> 6. My pages all have a style based on a css file that makes it so each div and paragraph have the same font
			sizes, indent size, and also text color. I also made sure the spacing between these divs and paragraphs is the
			same across all my pages. </li>

			<li> 7. My site has many images, and each contains an alt attribute for each image that describes what the image is supposed to
			be showing to the viewer. </li>

			<li> 8. Each page has a favicon link in the head. </li>

			<li> 9. My website is organized with folders for images and css files, while html files are in the html folder where the image
			and css folders are. In my images folder, there are subfolders for specific images used only on some websites. </li>

			<li> 10. My website does not use any frameworks for the base of each webpage. </li>

			<li> 11. After checking each of my css and html files through their respective validator, I have no errors on either of them. </li>

			<li> 12. I have stored my website in my UWEC Github account and have shared it with you. </li>

			<li> 13. Every file of mine is lowercase, and only contains letters of the alphabet, numbers, and underscores without capitalize
			letters. </li>

			<li> 14. Each of my items is on specific axes based on margins, or aligning items to the center of the screen. Each axes
			is clearly defined when looking at items in my webpage. </li>

			<li> 15. My website uses different font types for div's, p's, and also h2's. The fonts for div's and p's are Palatino Linotype, Book Antiqua, 
			and Palatino, while the font type for h2's are Times New Roman and serif. </li>

			<li> 17. I have many links to outside websites such as ssbwiki and YouTube videos for tutorials on SSBM techniques. Each
			link has a target of "_blank" so it will open in a new tab when clicked. </li>

			<li> 18. My code is in a readable formatt with consistent conventions and style across all my pages. I also follow the
			class and id rule stricktly so my webpage had less errors when running it through the validators. </li>

			<li> 22. Since many of my images are from open source websites in the community, I did not have to worry about copyright
			as long as I am not claiming the image as my own. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2> A Critique From My Client </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Regarding the background of the website, I believe that the color could have been more unique and expressive compared to a solid black. </li>
			
			<li> The history page could have included more in-depth information regarding the smash scene instead of just summarizing the key points that happened during
			those time periods.</li>
			
			<li> I would also love to see more information on the Character Data, Competitive Players, also Ruleset sites. I believe there is more content that can get added 
			instead of just having baseline information. </li>
		</ul>
