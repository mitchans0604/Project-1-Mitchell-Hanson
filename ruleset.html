			<h2><i> Why have rules for Competitive SSBM? </i></h2>
			<p> As with any sport like football soccer ect. there are rules to the game.  In Super Smash Brothers there is a options menu that lets you change settings to 
			modify the games rules.  Examples of those rules are to have items turned on at certain spawn rates (low medium high) turn off/on certain stages add a timer and also change  the gamemode.
			So if you are playing any smash game casually you can play by your own "house" rules but in order to standardize the experience for a competitive scene the community created a ruleset.
			This ruleset has some interesting history behind it so if you are curious you can look in History for the specifics.
