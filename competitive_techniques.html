			<h2><i> What Are Competitive Techniques? </i></h2>
			<p> Competitive Techniques are a series of actions that define the baseline for Competitive Melee.  These can include a series of button inputs or just understanding how to move your character around a stage.
			Below is a small list of the techniques that are used in every/most matches of SSBM.

			<ol>
				<li class = "five_tech_li"> <u>Dash Dancing</u> is the most fundamental technique to have your character move fluently on the ground.  This technique lets you cancel your dash animation 
				to dash another direction.  Example <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG3hIEI-oAk" target = "_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li class = "five_tech_li"> <u>Short Hopping</u> is a mechanic where your character will jump half of the height compared to a full hop.  To input a short hop you need to press and 
				let go of the jump button within the frames of a jump squat.  This technique is character dependent.  Example <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF66L9UFvPo" target = "_blank">here</a>. </li>
				<li class = "five_tech_li"> <u>Wavedashing</u> is what lets SSBM be the most precise 2D platformer fighting game of all time.  Many other games have copied what wavedashing does 
				and how it works.  To input it you must air dodge into the ground before your character touches the ground to either land faster or slide a distance.  
				Example <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EcPgWGiEhk" target = "_blank">here</a>. </li>
				<li class = "five_tech_li"> <u>L-canceling</u> is another technique that creates the competitive standards but is usually learned a little later because first you must know how 
				to move around in the game.  L-cancelling lets you cut the endlag of aerials in half.  With this technique you are able to perform the combos that professional 
				players are seen doing at tournaments.  Example <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNuYq7_nwzY" target = "_blank">here</a>. </li>
				<li class = "five_tech_li"> The final technique to learn is a combination of 2 of the other 4 techniques.  <u>SHFFL</u> is an acronym for Short Hop Fast Fall L-Cancel.  To perform 
				this technique you will short hop then fast fall out of the short hop next perform an aerial finally L-Cancel the aerial.  In every modern competitive set you 
				will see this technique being used.  It is the core of how to combo your opponent which is the most unique aspect of SSBM.  Combining SHFFL and the other 4 techniques above is 
				what is required of every competitive player in order to compete at smaller tournaments and win super majors.
