			<h2><i> How Has COVID Impacted SSBM?</i></h2>
			<p> When the COVID pandemic was starting, all super majors were closing because of the virus, and many local tournmanets were also shutting down for the same reasons.
			Therefore, the start of 2020 did not have many tournaments to base players skills off, and a ranking system for 2020 has yet to be created. 
			</p>
			
			<p>The lack of tournaments also stunted the scenes growth at first, since the only contributions were top players streams of them playing netplay against either fans, or other top players.
			To keep tournament play going, some organizations created online tournaments with Dolphin netplay and the use of Anther's Ladder to create brackets and host the tournament.
			Even if Dolphin netplay is not the greatest way to play SSBM, it is better than Nintendo Online for SSBU, which is having a struggle with creating a solid online 
			tournament experience because of the horrible online service.</p>
			
			<p> In June 22, 2020 a Software Engineer with a Twitter account name Fizzi, gave the community what it needed during a pandemic. He released the software called Slippi,
			a Dolphin build with "rollback netcode, integrated matchmaking, auto-updates, and replays". With these new features added to Dolphin via Slippi, 
			Fizzi created a new future of online Melee. After more players are getting into Melee, the online tournament scene is more reliable to compete it, and it sets the 
			standard for what is to come with the future of Melee. A link to the Tweet where Fizzi announced Slippi <a href = "https://twitter.com/Fizzi36/status/1275096470765490176?s=20" target = "_blank">here</a>.
