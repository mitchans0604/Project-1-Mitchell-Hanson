			<h2><i> How To Find Online Tournaments </i></h2>
			
			<p> The main site to look for tournaments is called Anther's Ladder. This site lets you create an account to compete, or play netplay with people online.
			Not only that, but it has a Tournament Finder that lets you find an online tournament within a certain vicinity. You can find online tournaments for SSBM,
			SSBU, SSBB, Project +, or SSB64. The site is still in early release, but it is functional and works well to find tournaments within a certain range of yourself if
			you do not want to leave the comfort of your home. Link to Anther's Ladder Tournament Finder<a href = "" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p> Another website that lets you find online tournaments is called Slippi. This is the same site that created a modern netplay system with rollback and player ques.
			So, you are able to download the software to play online against other players and find Super Majors to attend online and play against others across the globe!
			<a href = "https://slippi.gg/tournaments" target = "_blank">Here</a> is the link to Slippi's tournament page.</p>

			<h2><i> How To Find Events In Person Tournaments </i></h2>
			<p> To find tournaments in person, there are two sites that the community commonly uses. The first
			is <b>Smash.gg</b>, a site created to show every Super Major over the entire year. Other benefits of 
			Smash.gg are knowing the bracket you are in before you attend the tournament, and if you are not
			attending the tournament you are able to see the entire bracket update in real time. Link to smash.gg <a href = "https://smash.gg/" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
